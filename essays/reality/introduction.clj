;; ## Welcome to the Road to Reality!
;;
;; Still nothing here, but I am getting started.

;; Introduce here what I'm trying to do. Fascination with these books, and with
;; our ability to model reality. I've chosen and built a set of tools to do this
;; that are maximally extensible you should be able to read these in the same
;; environment where I wrote them, typesetting any changes you make with very
;; little effort.

;; And you should be able to go off in directions that I had never imagined
;; before, and trivially share those changes back out to me.

;; Of course nothing is actually trivial, but it's time to kick the tires on this
;; round of tools and see where we can go.

;; We are going to start with a Lisp interpreter, and build a powerful, modern
;; computer algebra system capable of solving Einstein's field equations. Some of
;; this tooling exists, and some of it we'll be building together in support of
;; the essays.

;; The algebra system lives at blah. Some of the essays are going to build up
;; simpler versions of tools in that library. Some of the essays will be almost
;; identical to the way the tools have been built in that library!

;; I have an idea of where we're going, but I expect to drag you off in all sorts
;; of interesting mathematical and historical directions. The difference between
;; this and your typical mathematical blog or book is that everything we explore
;; will be usable by you, potentially in your own work, potentially in a personal
;; playground that you can model off of these essays.

;; I have dreams about a collaborative version of all of this that you can read
;; about at blah. That will all come once we get some of the essays going.

;; In the meantime, the best I will be able to do is include this repository,
;; with instructions on how you can follow along in your own sort of scratchpad.
;; If you really want to get involved I will suggest a few exercises in each
;; essay. Remember, we are on alpha version, so expect these to change!
